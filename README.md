# Task 1:
## Hangman Game:

it is a word-guessing game.
The player chooses a category, a secret word is randomly picked from the selected category,
then the player tries to guess the secret word. 

When the player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, 
the game draws part of a stickman for each wrong guess.

When the player guesses a letter that is in the word,
the letter is assigned to its location and the game continues.

If the drawing of the stickman is completed then he will be hanged and the player loses.

If the player guesses the secret word right before the drawing is completed he wins and the stickman is saved.
