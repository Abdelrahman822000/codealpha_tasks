# Task 1: Hangman Game

Hangman is a word-guessing game. The player chooses a category, and a secret word is randomly picked from the selected category. The player then tries to guess the secret word.

- **Wrong Guess:** When the player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, the game draws part of a stickman for each wrong guess.
- **Correct Guess:** When the player guesses a letter that is in the word, the letter is assigned to its location, and the game continues.
- **Losing:** If the drawing of the stickman is completed, the stickman is hanged, and the player loses.
- **Winning:** If the player guesses the secret word right before the drawing is completed, they win, and the stickman is saved.

You can find the game [here](./Task1_HangmanGame_Final_Version%20v.1.6.7).

# Task 2: Basic Chatbot

Chatbots are software applications designed to simulate conversation with human users. They interact through text and can answer questions.

You can find the chatbot [here](./Task2_BasicChatbot_Final_Version%20v.2.2.6).

# Task 3: Task Automation

Task automation is designed to minimize or completely remove the need for manual intervention in executing straightforward tasks.

## Example: 
Let’s illustrate this with a creative example named “Thanos.” In this scenario, whenever “Thanos” snaps his fingers, equipped with the powerful Infinity Stones (initiated by the user pressing the ‘start’ button), a catastrophic event occurs: half of the entities within the universe are randomly selected and eliminated (symbolized by the deletion of half the files in the folder "universe"). Conversely, should the heroes prevail and one manages to snap their fingers with the Infinity Stones (the user hits ‘reset’), the decimated population is miraculously revived (restoring all previously deleted files).
