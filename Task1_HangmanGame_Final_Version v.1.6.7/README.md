# About Hangman Game

It is a word-guessing game. The player chooses a category, and a secret word is randomly picked from the selected category. The player then tries to guess the secret word.

- **Wrong Guess:** When the player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, the game draws part of a stickman for each wrong guess.
- **Correct Guess:** When the player guesses a letter that is in the word, the letter is assigned to its location, and the game continues.
- **Losing:** If the drawing of the stickman is completed, the stickman is hanged, and the player loses.
- **Winning:** If the player guesses the secret word right before the drawing is completed, they win, and the stickman is saved.
