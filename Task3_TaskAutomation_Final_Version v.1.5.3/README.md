# TaskAutomation:

Task automation is designed to minimize or completely remove the need for manual intervention in executing straightforward tasks.

## Example: 

Let’s illustrate this with a creative example named “Thanos.” 
## About Thanos:

Thanos is a supervillain from the Marvel Universe,
he assembles the six Infinity Gems and uses them to exterminate half of the universe’s population.

## Thanos Task

In this scenario, whenever “Thanos” snaps his fingers, equipped with the powerful Infinity Stones (initiated by the user pressing the ‘start’ button), a catastrophic event occurs: half of the entities within the universe are randomly selected and eliminated (symbolized by the deletion of half the files in the folder "universe"). Conversely, should the heroes prevail and one manages to snap their fingers with the Infinity Stones (the user hits ‘reset’), the decimated population is miraculously revived (restore all previously deleted files).

# Instructions:

First, check that you have Python3 downloaded 
Then check that you have "tkinter" and "customtkinter" libraries downloaded

If the libraries aren't downloaded you can download them by typing this commands in the terminal or CMD:
- pip install tkinter
- pip install customtkinter

Make sure that the folder "Thanos" is in the same directory as "Thanos.py"

After checking you can now run the game by opening "Thanos.bat".

Or You can run the code in "Thanos.py".

# How to use:

Press start to exterminate half of the universe’s population.
Press reset to restore the universe’s population.
