# TaskAutomation

Task automation is designed to minimize or completely remove the need for manual intervention in executing straightforward tasks.

## Example

Let’s illustrate this with a creative example named “Thanos.” 

## About Thanos

Thanos is a supervillain from the Marvel Universe. He assembles the six Infinity Gems and uses them to exterminate half of the universe’s population.

## Thanos Task

In this scenario, whenever “Thanos” snaps his fingers, equipped with the powerful Infinity Stones (initiated by the user pressing the ‘start’ button), a catastrophic event occurs: half of the entities within the universe are randomly selected and eliminated (symbolized by the deletion of half the files in the folder "universe"). Conversely, should the heroes prevail and one manages to snap their fingers with the Infinity Stones (the user hits ‘reset’), the decimated population is miraculously revived (restore all previously deleted files).

# Instructions

1. **Check Python3:** Ensure you have Python3 installed.
2. **Install Libraries:** Ensure you have "tkinter" and "customtkinter" libraries installed. If not, install them using the following commands:
   - `pip install tkinter`
   - `pip install customtkinter`
3. **Prepare Folder:**
   - Make sure that the folder "Thanos" is in the same directory as "Thanos.py".
4. **Run the App:**
   - Open "Thanos.bat" to start the application.
   - Or run the code in "Thanos.py".

# How to Use

- **Press Start:** Exterminate half of the universe’s population.
- **Press Reset:** Restore the universe’s population.
