# About Chatbot

Chatbots are software applications designed to simulate conversation with human users. They interact through text and can answer questions.

# Instructions

1. **Check Python3:** Ensure you have Python3 installed.
2. **Install Libraries:** Ensure you have "tkinter" and "customtkinter" libraries installed. If not, install them using the following commands:
   - `pip install tkinter`
   - `pip install customtkinter`
3. **Run the Chatbot:**
   - Open "EasyTalker.bat" to start the chatbot.
   - Or run the code in "EasyTalker.py".

# How to Use

- After opening, you can type whatever you want to say to the chatbot, and it will respond to you.
- Note: This is a basic chatbot not made with AI. It has predefined questions and responses. If you ask a question it doesn't know, it won't understand.
- To see what questions you can ask the chatbot, check "Pairs.py".
